The following is a script that takes a list of almost daily data entries for a number of stocks and gives you each unique stock along with the overall change in value of the stock within a year, the percentage change in value in a year and the total trading volume of the stock. It highlights the stocks with the greatest increase and decrease in price as well as the stock with the highest trading volume in the given year. It also loops through multiple worksheets, turning large sets of data into smaller more manageable sets within the same worksheet
Included are some screenshots of the results of the running it on some excel data
